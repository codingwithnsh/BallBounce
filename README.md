# Ball Bounce App

The **Ball Bounce App** is a simple and interactive project created using **MIT App Inventor**. It demonstrates how to use the Canvas, Ball, and basic event handling to create a bouncing ball effect.

## Features
- **Interactive Ball Movement**: The ball can be flung in any direction, and its speed and direction are controlled by the user's gesture.
- **Bounce Effect**: The ball bounces back when it hits the edge of the screen.
- **Dynamic Motion**: The app uses speed, heading, and edge detection to simulate realistic motion.

## How It Works
1. **Canvas Component**: Acts as the playground for the ball to move.
2. **Ball Component**: Represents the moving object.
3. **Blocks Logic**:
   - Detects the ball's fling and sets its speed and heading.
   - Reacts to the ball hitting the edge by making it bounce.

## Requirements
- **MIT App Inventor**: [https://appinventor.mit.edu](https://appinventor.mit.edu).
- A mobile device or emulator to test the app.
